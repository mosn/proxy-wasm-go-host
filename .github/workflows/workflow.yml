    # A matrix proves the supported range of Go versions work. This must always
    # include the floor Go version policy of Mosn and the current Go version.
    # Mosn's floor Go version for libraries is two behind current, e.g. if Go
    # supports 1.19 and 1.20, Mosn libraries must work on 1.18, 1.19 and 1.20.
    #
    # A floor version is required to ensure Mosn can receive security patches.
    # Without one, dependencies become locked to an old version of Go, which
    # itself receives no security patch updates.
    #
    # Mosn's binary is built with Go's floor version, e.g. if Go supports 1.19
    # and 1.20, Mosn will build any downloadable executables with 1.19.
    #
    # Even if mosn works with a Go version below its supported floor, users
    # must not depend on this. Mosn and its library dependencies are free to
    # use features in the supported floor Go version at any time. This remains
    # true even if mosn library dependencies are not eagerly updated.
